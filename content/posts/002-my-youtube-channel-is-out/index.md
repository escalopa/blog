Yes you read that correct!! I am on YouTube now and here is **[the channel](https://www.youtube.com/@escalopa)**

**On the 21st of October 2022**, I started my YouTube channel to document my journey and monitor my progress.

If took my a while to actually know how to use OBS Studio for recording, besides that I was soo nervous talking in front of the camera, 
I felt this blood pressure rising, fast heart beats, But I am more than sure that it is just a matter of time and everything will change.

Today is the born of a new me who wants to become valuable to the society and achieve something good maybe I am not good at something now, But I believe in the quote

> To become good you have to be bad and to become bad you have to try.

This is the start of the path to find the real me. I don't feel my self working a 9 to 5 job(despite I haven't worked yet ðŸ˜„), So as my brother once told me. 

> If you don't know where to go then start walking.

So this is all for this article. Stay tuned for more!
